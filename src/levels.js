    description: `<p class="text-gray-700 text-md">
      In CSS, the \`align-self\` property controls the vertical alignment of a single flex item, overriding the container’s <code>align-items</code> property. It accepts the following values: <strong>flex-start</strong>, <strong>flex-end</strong>, <strong>center</strong>, <strong>stretch</strong>, and <strong>baseline</strong>. In Tailwind CSS, these become utility classes:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
      <li>
        <strong>self-start</strong>: Aligns the item to the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>self-end</strong>: Aligns the item to the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>self-center</strong>: Aligns the item in the center vertically.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>self-stretch</strong>: Stretches the item to fill the container (default).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>self-baseline</strong>: Aligns the item based on its text baseline.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
      For example, 
      <code class="text-green-500">align-self: center;</code> in CSS places a monkey at the bottom of the vine. The Tailwind equivalent is <code class="text-green-500">self-center</code>.

      In CSS, the \`flex-wrap\` property controls whether flex items stay on a single line or wrap onto multiple lines when they overflow the container.

    </p>
